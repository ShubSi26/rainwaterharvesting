    <div id="container3"> <div id="prgf"><span id="R">R</span>ainwater harvesting (RWH) is the collection and storage of rain, rather than allowing it to run off. Rainwater is collected from a roof-like surface and redirected to a tank, cistern, deep pit (well, shaft, or borehole), aquifer, or a reservoir with percolation, so that it seeps down and restores the ground water. Dew and fog can also be collected with nets or other tools. Rainwater harvesting differs from stormwater harvesting as the runoff is typically collected from roofs and other surfaces for storage and subsequent reuse.Its uses include watering gardens, livestock, irrigation, domestic use with proper treatment, and domestic heating. The harvested water can also be committed to longer-term storage or groundwater recharge.

        Rainwater harvesting is one of the simplest and oldest methods of self-supply of water for households, having been used in South Asia and other countries for many thousands of years. Installations can be designed for different scales including households, neighbourhoods and communities and can also be designed to serve institutions such as schools, hospitals and other public facilities.</div></div>

        <div id="container4" class="grd"><h1 id="apl">Applications</h1>
            <div class="applec">Domestic use<p class="pgf">Rooftop rainwater harvesting is used to provide drinking water, domestic water, water for livestock, water for small irrigation, and a way to replenish groundwater levels.</p></div>
            <div class="applec">Agriculture use<p class="pgf">In regards to urban agriculture, rainwater harvesting in urban areas reduces the impact of runoff and flooding. The combination of urban ‘green’ rooftops with rainwater catchments have been found to reduce building temperatures by more than 1.3 degrees Celsius.[9] Rainwater harvesting in conjunction with urban agriculture would be a viable way to help meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for cleaner and sustainable cities, health and wellbeing, and food and water security (Sustainable Development Goal 6). The technology is available, however, it needs to be remodeled in order to use water more efficiently, especially in an urban setting.

            <div class="applec">Industry use<p class="pgf">Rainwater harvesting was adopted at The Velodrome – The London Olympic Park – in order to increase the sustainability of the facility. A 73% decrease in potable water demand by the park was estimated. Despite this, it was deemed that rainwater harvesting was a less efficient use of financial resources to increase sustainability than the park's blackwater recycling program.[15]</p></div>

            <h2 id="tchq">Rooftop Rainwater harvesting</h2>
            <p id="detail">Rooftop Rain Water Harvesting is the technique through which rain water is
                captured from the roof catchments and stored in reservoirs. Harvested rain water
                can be stored in sub-surface ground water reservoir by adopting artificial
                recharge techniques to meet the household needs through storage in tanks.
                The Main Objective of rooftop rain water harvesting is to make water available for
                future use. Capturing and storing rain water for use is particularly important in
                dryland, hilly, urban and coastal areas. In alluvial areas energy saving for 1m.
                rise in ground water level is around 0.40 kilo watt per hour.</p>
